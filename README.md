# Simple example use about C tools
Tree exercises about simple logic in C to GNU OS. We will work with this follow points:

1. [Header Files](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Header-Files.html)
2. [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
3. [Sort Algorithm](http://visualgo.net/sorting)
4. [Pointer](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)
5. [Structures](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html#Structures)

### Triangle Calculator
This software will calculate the sides, perimeter and area of the triangle
from tree given points in the Cartesian plane. We will use to implement this
tree points: Header Files, Makefile and Structures.

### Usage
To use this software you just need navegate to the directory, run the Makefike
and the bin will be created in the folder bin. See the follow example:
```sh
cd triangle_calculator/
make
./bin/triangle_calculator
```
